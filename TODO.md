* Make it harder to get a feature-complete Bohrok deck (e.g. only 1 copy of each Lv4 in base, need to get more from path/mixed pack)
* Balancing: Toa base pack doesn't give you 40 in main without any expansions, maybe the same should be true for Bohrok?
  - Have to make sure it's close enough that you can't lock yourself out of getting a functional deck!
* Replace low-res images if possible
